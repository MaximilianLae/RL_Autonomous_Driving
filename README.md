# RL_Autonomous_Driving

This project is focused on developing an RL agent capable of solving an environment for decision-making in Autonomous Driving. 

Autonomous Driving has long been considered a field in which RL algorithms excel, and this project aims to leverage the power of RL to create an intelligent agent that can solve the Farama’s foundation “highway-env” project, namely the Highway environment (refer to https://highway-env.farama.org/environments/highway/).
